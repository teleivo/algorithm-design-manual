# The Algorithm Design Manual


Hi 😁 this is one of my learning repositories. I go through some of the exercises from the Algorithm
Design Manual book https://www.algorist.com. It is a great book you can go through together with the
lectures.

Note that some the design decisions are optimized for convenience in testing and actually
implementing a solution. Most of the time the naive assumption that user input is valid is made. The
book has so many exercises that I cannot put in the same effort as I would for production code 😅.
So there is often plenty of room for refactoring which I did not spend much if any time on.
