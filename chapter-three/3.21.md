# 3.21

Concat two sets S1 and S2 into one BST in which every key in S1 < S2. The worst case running time
should be O(h) in which h is the maximum height of both trees.

I am assuming both sets are implemented using a BST. I would find the max node in S1 and set its
right to S2. The BST invariant of S1 would still hold. The resulting BST would then not be balanced
anymore if S1 was balanced and S2 depth > 1. I don't see a way around that with the constraint of
O(h) though. Creating a new balanced BST would require touching all elements.
