# 3.16

Storage efficiency ratio of two binary tree implementations. I am going to refer to the ratio as R.

These are just sketches of how the tree could look in Go.

a) assume all fields take 4 bytes

```go
type node struct {
    data   int
    parent *node
    left   *node
    right  *node
}
```

    R = 4/16 = 1/4 = 25%

b) assume pointers are 2 bytes and data 4 bytes

```go
type node struct {
    left  *node
    right *node
}

type leaf struct {
    data int
}
```

To fit N data elements we need `N-1` internal `node`s and `N` `leaf`s. This amounts to a total of `M
= 2N-1` nodes.

    R = N/(2N-1)

We can neglect the `-1` for large `N` and simplify

    R = N/2N = 1/2 = 50%

So `b)` is more efficient than `a)` when it comes to space. However, that is only true since
internal and leaf nodes take the same amount of space in `b)` because the pointers are said to take
2 bytes while they take 4 bytes in `a)`.

If we make the pointers also take 4 bytes in `b)` we get

    R = 4N/(8N-1+4N) = 4N/(12N-1) ~ 1/3 ~ 33%
