Given dictionary backed by BST containing n strings of at most l length find all strings with prefix
p. Do so in O(ml log n) time. m is the number of strings.

I assume I am not allowed to manipulate the data structure and only use its API. I am confused why
the definition states m and n as the number of strings. Is m supposed to mean the number of strings
with the prefix p? That does not seem plausible with the API available as I have no way of
knowing/starting at the first string with prefix p.

I think I can solve this by iterating over all strings starting at min() advancing using
successor(). Both operations take O(log n). Check each string for prefix p. In Go-like pseudocode

```go
var result []string
for n:=findMin(dict); n!=nil; n=successor(dict, n) {
    if hasPrefix(p, n.Value) {
        result = append(result, n.Value)
    }
}
```

The operations inside the loop take O(l) (prefix check) time. The loop is executed O(n log n) time.
We could probably exit early after having found a string with a prefix and then having found the
first successor that does not have the prefix.
