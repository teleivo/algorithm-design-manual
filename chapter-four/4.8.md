## a

I am assuming there is function to get from a bill to a check and vice-versa in constant time.

1. Using sorting in O(N log N) time and O(N) space
  - sort both bills and checks
  - iterate over bills
    - if the check matches the bill advance the check
    - else collect the check into an unpaid collection

2. Using a map in O(N) time and space
  - put bills into map
  - iterate over checks
    - remove corresponding bill
  - collect remaining keys into unpaid collection

## b

Map-reduce in O(N) time and O(M) space M being the number of companies.

## c

1. Using sorting in O(N log N) time and O(N) space
2. Using a map in O(N) time and space
